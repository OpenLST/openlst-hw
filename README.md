OpenLST Reference Hardware
==========================

This repository contains a KiCad project with a hardware reference
implementation for the OpenLST.  This design is a simplified version
of the Texas Instruments CC1110 432 MHz reference design.  A 1 watt
power amplifier module has been added to increase operating range.
The design is intended for use at 437 MHz, however, it may be modified
for use at other frequencies.

The user is responsible for obtaining and maintaining the necessary
license to operate this radio.  The example project uses frequencies
in the US Amateur Radio UHF band. Transmissions in this band require a
valid FCC license and compliance with CFR Part 97.
